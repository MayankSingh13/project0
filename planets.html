					<h3> Mercury </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. 
						It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide 
						outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. 
						It is the smallest planet in the Solar System

					<h3> Venus </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon,
						Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. It lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either 
						setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[18] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, 
						it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus

					<h3> Earth </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 
						billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around 
						the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.

					<h3> Mars </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to 
						as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
						Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

					<h3> Jupiter </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the
						Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the 
						Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[19] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

					<h3> Saturn </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average 
						density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
						The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in 
						the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

					<h3> Uranus </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical 
						compositions. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. It has the coldest 
						planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration 
						because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.

					<h3> Neptune </h3>
					<p style='text-align:center'>
						Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
						It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of 
						its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU. It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
