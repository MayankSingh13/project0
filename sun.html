			<p style='text-align:center'> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
			with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of 
			energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass 
			is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters 
			of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, 
			including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, 
			converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000
			years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized 
			since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around
			the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the predominant calendar in use today.
