						Pluto is an icy dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.
						Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known 
						trans-Neptunian object by volume. Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume.

						The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth as its only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, and by far the largest among 
						planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits. The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known. 
						The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left 
						over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia.

						Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only known 
						body in space, other than Earth, where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found.Titan is the sixth gravitationally rounded moon from Saturn. 
						Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's
						moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.

						Ceres is the largest object in the main asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. With a diameter of 940 km (580 mi), Ceres is both the largest of the 
						asteroids and the only unambiguous dwarf planet currently inside Neptune's orbit. It is the 25th-largest body in the Solar System within the orbit of Neptune. Ceres was the 
						first asteroid to be discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi on 1 January 1801. It was originally considered a planet, but was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after many other 
						objects in similar orbits were discovered.

					<p style='text-align:center'>
						A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere 
						or coma, and sometimes also a tail. Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. 
						This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from 
						the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma).

						Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, is the largest and most massive of the Solar System's moons. The ninth-largest object in the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial 
						atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268 km (3,273 mi) and is 8% larger than the planet Mercury, although only 45% as massive. Possessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of 
						inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. Ganymede's discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei, who was the first to 
						observe it on January 7, 1610.
